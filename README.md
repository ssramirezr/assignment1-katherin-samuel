This is the implementation given to Assignment 1 of the Formal Languages and Compilers course by students *Samuel Acosta Aristizabal* and *Katherin Nathalia Allin Murillo*.

In this README we are going to show the language used, operating system and how it is executed:

The language used for this solution was Python and Windows Operating System version 11.
This is a Python script that minimizes a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) by finding equivalent states. 

## EXECUTION:

1. Save the code in a file, for example, dfa_minimizer.py.
2.	Run the script from the command line: python dfa_minimizer.py
3.	When running this script the program waits for the user to enter data describing one or more DFA and after processing the input, prints the pairs of states that are equivalent according to the DFA minimization process
